Synaccord is beta testing a web app that helps people have structured conversations in diverse groups so they find the solutions that unite us and disrupt the polarization and paralysis that we are getting now. Try it out, democracy needs you.\nBut sign up quickly, the test group closes and the discussion starts on 8/12/2015 at 4:00PM PDT.\n\nThanks!",

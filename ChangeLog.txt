AskItemWhy - if you reload, it refetches entered data, and updates the constraints - but it doesn't automatically advance (should it? that will be harder)
QsortItems - implemented min requirement, constraints are listed in the DoneItems box at the bottom
smoothScroll - typo
qsortWhy - does not use min/max constraints - just makes sure there is an answer for each why

ask-item-why would not proceed if there was previous data in the db - item-subject & item-description will generate CREATOR_DIRTY actions when component receives new props
smoothScroll - call "S"crollFocus

storybook - separated into multiple story files. created story for react-scrollbar
react-scrollbar - fixed bug that caused jumping - it wasn't really scrolling as intended.
next-step - shows instructions, shows buttons, removed unused actions
dynamic-selector - eliminated React child key complaint
smooth-scroll - calls react-scrollbar.SmoothScroll instead of doing it separately.
api.js/server.js/set-user-cookie.js -  if id in cookie doesn't exist in db (different DB?) error out

apiWrapper.Flush fixed for turk - user not defined on initial render
4/22/2019
changed ENV name to AWSSecretAccessKey, added console.error messages, fixed error handling.
4/17/2019
fixed mechanical turk worker logins. user schema for turks, detailed. turk_user doesn't add assignmentID to db, raspPanelItems does not mount and never rerender the panels, (the user prop wasn't coming in on the first render)

rasp - supports 'default' child, client includes default actionToState so you can use actionFilters, deriveRASP instead. Fixed a bug in RASPClientMult and PanelList that when using SET_PATH would set the new child too early.

panel-list: smooth transitions working again, right-border added
ask-item-why - margins and padding beautiful
login-panel: type, and other panel props, are changed to that of the new type (not the login panel type)
support-accept-reject: prop type checking fixed

AskItemWhy - if you reload, it refetches entered data, and updates the constraints - but it doesn't automatically advance (should it? that will be harder)
QsortItems - implemented min requirement, constraints are listed in the DoneItems box at the bottom
smoothScroll - typo
qsortWhy - does not use min/max constraints - just makes sure there is an answer for each why
4/1/2019
ask-item-why would not proceed if there was previous data in the db - item-subject & item-description will generate CREATOR_DIRTY actions when component receives new props
smoothScroll - call "S"crollFocus

storybook - separated into multiple story files. created story for react-scrollbar
react-scrollbar - fixed bug that caused jumping - it wasn't really scrolling as intended.
next-step - shows instructions, shows buttons, removed unused actions
dynamic-selector - eliminated React child key complaint
smooth-scroll - calls react-scrollbar.SmoothScroll instead of doing it separately.
api.js/server.js/set-user-cookie.js -  if id in cookie doesn't exist in db (different DB?) error out

ItemStore - made sure the child Item not include item as a prop. (qsort-flip-item, rasp-panel-items, refine, panel-questions, qsort-finale, qsort-relook, qsort-flip-item, qsort-why )
Item - chrome flipmove inherited background color problem fixed - style is passed to item; qsort-refine,
Path not restored past redirect - fixed - only use strings as RASP client names - login-panel, profile-panel
QSortRefine - don't double qsort items when restoring state from path
ReactActionStatePath - upgraded to React 16.8.6 and fix for back button not storing state because of confusion over leading /
5/2/2019
ask-item-why - passes items in RESULTS action so they can be added to the random items
profile-panel - passes ...panel to the typecomponent as well so the type will changed
start.js - more error messages, but still not catching the error that the server can't start because the port is in use

Harmony - doesn't render until fetch has completed.
Promote - if an item, but not one to compare to - then promote auto completes
Refine - cleaned up unreachable completed
PanelStore - shows loading until fetch has completed, fixed problem with createItem triggering in the wrong panel
AskItemWhy - sends ISSUES and RESULTS to parent (PanelList), doens't autocomplete - but if restoring from path PanelList will move it forward
CafeIdea - created noResults prop so that it won't put results into shared - but this is a Kludge and we need a more general method
DiscussionGroupSync - will move auto advance  by FOCUS event from panel list if sync is complete, better cleanup of timer on unmount, sends RESULTS and ISSUES to PanelList so auto advance while resoring from path will worker
PanelList - sends FOCUS to the panel being changed to, adjusts height of current panel in a way that keeps the bottom border
AcceptSupportOppose - has border around buttons
panel.less - added a comment that syn-panel-list-rotary needs to be in a class and won't work if it's in a style that keeps changing

apiWrapper.Flush fixed for turk - user not defined on initial render
4/22/2019
changed ENV name to AWSSecretAccessKey, added console.error messages, fixed error handling.
4/17/2019
fixed mechanical turk worker logins. user schema for turks, detailed. turk_user doesn't add assignmentID to db, raspPanelItems does not mount and never rerender the panels, (the user prop wasn't coming in on the first render)
4/12/2019
rasp - supports 'default' child, client includes default actionToState so you can use actionFilters, deriveRASP instead. Fixed a bug in RASPClientMult and PanelList that when using SET_PATH would set the new child too early.
4/3/2019
panel-list: smooth transitions working again, right-border added
ask-item-why - margins and padding beautiful
login-panel: type, and other panel props, are changed to that of the new type (not the login panel type)
support-accept-reject: prop type checking fixed
4/2/2019
AskItemWhy - if you reload, it refetches entered data, and updates the constraints - but it doesn't automatically advance (should it? that will be harder)
QsortItems - implemented min requirement, constraints are listed in the DoneItems box at the bottom
smoothScroll - typo
qsortWhy - does not use min/max constraints - just makes sure there is an answer for each why
4/1/2019
ask-item-why would not proceed if there was previous data in the db - item-subject & item-description will generate CREATOR_DIRTY actions when component receives new props
smoothScroll - call "S"crollFocus
3/29/2019
storybook - separated into multiple story files. created story for react-scrollbar
react-scrollbar - fixed bug that caused jumping - it wasn't really scrolling as intended.
next-step - shows instructions, shows buttons, removed unused actions
dynamic-selector - eliminated React child key complaint
smooth-scroll - calls react-scrollbar.SmoothScroll instead of doing it separately.
api.js/server.js/set-user-cookie.js -  if id in cookie doesn't exist in db (different DB?) error out
